# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

## SUMMARY

The first thing I did was to clone the remote repository on GitHub. After that, I created a folder called 'assignments' which contains 2 more folders: 'branch' and 'merging'. These two folders contain txt files that will be filled with explanations about branching and merging according to their folder names.

After that, I was required to make a minimum of 5 commits. I did this by filling in explanations for each commit about the material, mandate, function, title, and example.

Once I completed these commits, I then had to create a new branch named 'experiment' and added a new file to it. Then, I committed the changes. I created another new branch named 'feature' which contained additional explanations from the file I created earlier in the 'experiment' branch. I merged 'feature' and 'experiment', then rebased 'experiment' onto 'main' and merged 'experiment' back into 'main'.

Beforehand, I had pushed the 'main' branch to the GitHub repository I had created earlier. Then, I pushed 'experiment' and submitted a pull request. After that, I merged 'experiment' into 'main' in the GitHub repository. Then, I invited some of my internship team members to collaborate.

## CHALLENGES

The problem I encountered during this task was when I mistakenly merged from the wrong repository. I was not careful enough when reading the instructions, which stated that I should merge into my own repository, not someone else's. Additionally, I faced challenges during the collaboration process. I found the pull request, but I couldn't perform a code review because I had already merged the changes, making it impossible to review them. Another issue that I haven't found a solution for yet is that I can't assign roles to my collaborators.
