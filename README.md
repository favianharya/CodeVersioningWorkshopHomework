# CodeVersioningWorkshopHomework

## SUMMARY

The first thing I did was to clone the remote repository on GitHub. After that, I created a folder called 'assignments' which contains 2 more folders: 'branch' and 'merging'. These two folders contain txt files that will be filled with explanations about branching and merging according to their folder names.

After that, I was required to make a minimum of 5 commits. I did this by filling in explanations for each commit about the material, mandate, function, title, and example.

Once I completed these commits, I then had to create a new branch named 'experiment' and added a new file to it. Then, I committed the changes. I created another new branch named 'feature' which contained additional explanations from the file I created earlier in the 'experiment' branch. I merged 'feature' and 'experiment', then rebased 'experiment' onto 'main' and merged 'experiment' back into 'main'.

Beforehand, I had pushed the 'main' branch to the GitHub repository I had created earlier. Then, I pushed 'experiment' and submitted a pull request. After that, I merged 'experiment' into 'main' in the GitHub repository. Then, I invited some of my internship team members to collaborate.
